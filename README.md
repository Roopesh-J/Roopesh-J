#### 👋 About Me
I'm Roopesh Jampala, I also go by Roopesh Mikkilineni. I had a name change in recent times and it hasn't been update everywhere just yet. I am a undergraduate student at Georgia State University studying Data Science. I am deeply interested in becoming better at machine learning practices and implementations. Some of my interestes in the data science world include network traffic optimization, object detection in sports film, and video game data. 

#### 🖥️ Experience 
I am very well versed in Python and have used it for various applications. I started learnign originally so I could learn how to automotically update an excel sheet and just took off from there. I have used it to data mine sports data, video game data, and even the youtube comment section. I gained much of my experience in python while attempting to make a Discord bot. While it didn't go well the first time, I have now made a few all using different libraries and having different applications. 

Most recently I started working at Cox Automotive as a data science intern where I work in an operations and risk management department. We deal with car auctions so most of my work is just looking at data on cars which has been a blast since I am a huge car guy. Here I picked up SQL and it's been great to use it after many years of Excel (which is still great). 

#### 🏀 Personal Interests
Outside of school I love playing sports and any sort of outdoor activity. Recently I have picked up chess and have become obssessed with it, I have always been into games and strategy games in particular. I am also a huge movie/tv show watcher, my entire family is big into it and so there was no escaping it when I was younger. Though I am not very good at photography, I love trying it whenever again and is something I always thinking about getting better at.
