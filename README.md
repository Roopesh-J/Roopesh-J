#### 👋 About Me
I'm Roopesh Jampala, I am an aspiring Data Scientist. I am deeply interested in becoming better at machine learning practices and implementations. I have a Bachelor's degree in Data Science. 

#### 🖥️ Experience 
I am very well versed in Python and have used it for various applications. I started learning originally so I could learn how to automotically update an excel sheet and just took off from there. I have used it to data mine sports data, video game data, and even the youtube comment section. I gained much of my experience in python while attempting to make a Discord bot. While it didn't go well the first time, I have now made a few all using different libraries and having different applications. 

Most recently I worked at Cox Automotive as a Data Analyst in the operations and risk management department. We deal with car auctions so most of my work is just looking at data on cars which has been a blast since I am a huge car guy. Here I picked up SQL and it's been great to use it after many years of Excel (which is still great). 

#### 🏀 Personal Interests
Outside of school I love playing sports and any sort of outdoor activity. Recently I have picked up chess and have become obssessed with it, I have always been into games and strategy games in particular. I am also a huge movie/tv show watcher, my entire family is big into it and so there was no escaping it when I was younger. Though I am not very good at photography, I love trying it whenever again and is something I always thinking about getting better at.
